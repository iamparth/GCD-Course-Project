# Getting and Cleaning Data Project #

Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course. One of the most exciting
areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop
the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the
accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Overview ##

This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full
description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Project Summary ##

The following is a summary description of the project instructions.

I have created one R script called **run_analysis.R** that does the following tasks mentioned below:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Additional Information ##

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
